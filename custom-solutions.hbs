        Security Debt <br> Reduction Sprint
    </h2>
    <div>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>"The Debt Clock is Ticking" – every day without strategic security leadership, your company accumulates security debt
        that compounds over time, becoming more expensive to resolve.</p>
        <h3>Risk</h3>
        <p>94% of SMBs faced at least one cyberattack in 2024, indicating a high level of vulnerability among these businesses
        <a href="https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/smb-cybersecurity-statistics/">NinjaOne</a>.</p>
        <p>The average cost of a data breach globally in 2024 was reported to be $4.88 million IBM.</p>
        <h3>What failed before</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Months-long assessments with little actionable guidance</li>
            <li>Generic recommendations that do not fit SMB realities</li>
            <li>Intimidating technical jargon without business context</li>
            <li>All-or-nothing pricing that breaks SMB budgets</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Your approach</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Business-first analysis:</b> Start by understanding how you make money.</li>
            <li><b>Risk-based prioritization:</b> Focus on threats that actually impact operations.</li>
            <li><b>Scalable implementation:</b> Solutions that grow with the business.</li>
            <li><b>Clear communication:</b> Security insights in plain business language.</li>
            <li><b>Platform-enabled delivery:</b> Use the CISO OnDemand SaaS platform for end-to-end program management and oversight, enabling
            one vCISO to manage multiple clients efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Security outcomes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prioritized backlog of security debt with clear ROI</li>
            <li>Short, time-boxed sprint that delivers visible progress</li>
            <li>Improved readiness for audits and customer security reviews</li>
        </ul>
